    <description>A process sandbox helps to manage and limit access permissions a process has to your data.  Use it to safely test new software for usability, safely study behavior of known spyware and malware, or browse the web from a sandboxed browser to completely shield your computer and network from Internet Bad Things.

## Parameters
If you want to use install parameters, use `sandboxie.install` package.

### Features
* Secure Web Browsing: Running your Web browser under the protection of Sandboxie means that all malicious software downloaded by the browser is trapped in the sandbox and can be discarded trivially.
* Enhanced Privacy: Browsing history, cookies, and cached temporary files collected while Web browsing stay in the sandbox and don't leak into Windows.
* Secure E-mail: Viruses and other malicious software that might be hiding in your email can't break out of the sandbox and can't infect your real system.
* Windows Stays Lean: Prevent wear-and-tear in Windows by installing software into an isolated sandbox.

### Free with no limitations
Since version 5.31.4 Sandboxie is now available for free with no limitations. Sophos is also planning on making this program open source.
