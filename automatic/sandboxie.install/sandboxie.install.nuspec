    <description>A process sandbox helps to manage and limit access permissions a process has to your data.  Use it to safely test new software for usability, safely study behavior of known spyware and malware, or browse the web from a sandboxed browser to completely shield your computer and network from Internet Bad Things.

## Parameters
- `/Language:LANG_CODE` - The installation language. Defaults to English. Replace `LANG_CODE` with LCID code (e.g. 1033 for US English) or BCP-47 language tag (e.g. en-US for US English) for your language. [List of supported languages](https://github.com/jack1142/choco-auto/blob/main/automatic/sandboxie.install/LANGUAGES.md)

These parameters can be passed to the installer with the use of `--params`.
For example: `--params '"/Language:en-US"'`

### Features
* Secure Web Browsing: Running your Web browser under the protection of Sandboxie means that all malicious software downloaded by the browser is trapped in the sandbox and can be discarded trivially.
* Enhanced Privacy: Browsing history, cookies, and cached temporary files collected while Web browsing stay in the sandbox and don't leak into Windows.
* Secure E-mail: Viruses and other malicious software that might be hiding in your email can't break out of the sandbox and can't infect your real system.
* Windows Stays Lean: Prevent wear-and-tear in Windows by installing software into an isolated sandbox.

### Free with no limitations
Since version 5.31.4 Sandboxie is now available for free with no limitations. Sophos open sourced the program on April 8th, 2020.
